- We include the Launch4j into Gradle. No need to make Jar any more, just we can type 'gradle createExe' andy changing the value of mainClass parameter.

- JSAP is also included to manage the command line arguments. now you can run the client passing its arguments on the command line like this:
$ equiz-client.exe -h localhost --port 10000 -u "sami fattani" -i MBA001

- Blank field now can be also used as Essay. I change the textField into textArea. It works fine.
